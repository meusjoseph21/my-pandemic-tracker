# Motivation
With COVID-19 being something that is so prevelant now and it's clear that this won't be leaving anytime soon we wanted to make something that could keep people informed.
This brought the idea of making My Pandemic Tracker. Using many technologies we made an app that updates real-time on the current infection rates along with the recent news on COVID-19.
